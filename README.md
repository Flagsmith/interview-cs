Consider the following support question from a customer:

> Hi - I’m trying to receive environment webhooks in my Express application, following this doc: https://docs.flagsmith.com/system-administration/webhooks#environment-web-hooks
> 
> I can’t get the signature to validate, and I don’t understand why. Am I doing something wrong? This is a simple application that reproduces the problem: https://github.com/Flagsmith/interview-cs
> 
> To run it, clone the repo and run:
> 
> ```
> npm install
> node index.js
> ```
> 
> I've tried using the "Test your webhook" button and real webhooks but neither works.
>
> Thanks!
